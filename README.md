Web accessibility

# Original version

Index.html although readable, lacked the proper semantics necessary for a more comprehensible layout so it can be more accessible for anyone interacting with the web page.

It was necessary to add the proper tags to the html to replace the various <div> tags that were used to create the layout. Because of this, it was necessary to identify the sections by classes in the styling file to give it a proper format.

# Changes

In the layout of the html almost all the <div> tags were replaced for different tags that represent what the actual page is trying to convey. By doing this, minor changes had to be made to the styling file to match the proper elements.
